## About Me
I’m a **Game Developer and Gameplay Programmer** with a strong foundation in **Unity, C#, and gameplay systems**, and hands-on experience with **Unreal Engine**.

I specialize in building **modular, scalable mechanics**, advanced player controllers, and immersive environments with a strong focus on **performance, maintainability, and player experience**.

With a multidisciplinary background that combines **programming, game design, audio composition, and quality assurance**, I approach development with both **creative vision and engineering discipline**.

Currently, I’m expanding my expertise in **Unreal Engine workflows**, **AI-assisted development**, and **cross-platform production pipelines**, while continuously refining my QA-driven approach to software quality.
